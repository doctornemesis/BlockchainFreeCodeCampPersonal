Lets start with FundMe file..

####
So, first.. we copied the .sol file file Github
then... we noticed that it contains @chainlink thing as import...

Now that comes as an NPM package...
and brownie doesnt know how to import NPM...

Hence, we looked for the same file in GITHUB and brownie knows how to take files from github...

We created the brownie-config.yaml file

#### DEPENDENCIES
then we created the dependencies section in that file...
This is used to store the location of those file from GITHUB
they can be easily downloaded... when we hit...
## brownie compile

but we need to redirect the compiler to help it understand..

what is @chainlink....

hence we create the compiler: solc: ...
and gave the meaning to @chainlink...

finally we hit
## brownie compile

all the dependencies were downloaded...

Then we created the .env file... same as before...

and the wallets section same as before...


#### QUICK TIP ABOUT ___init__.py file
#### okay... this file can help you 
#### import functions from other .py files
#### Well create this file in the same folder... 
Thats it...
