Okayyy...
The next question is....


#### HOW TO DEPLOY TO TESTNET

Here, first we will tell u about the Brownie Networks

well just run in Terminal

#### TERMINAL
    brownie networks list

#### HERE U WILL SEE, A BUNCH OF NETWORKS AVAILABLE TO US

Okay.. so you saw that apparently...

there is Ethereum section...
    where u have both mainnet and other testnets
    this is a permanent network...
        how???
        well u deploy and it stays in the contract...
        and well even in the different testnets....

there is a developments section...
    It has all the temperory networks
    nothing will be saved... whatever we do...


#### Now about running on a new network
Suppose we want to run our code on Rinkeby
Well simple...

Go to Terminal and....

#### Terminal
    brownie run scripts\deploy.py --network rinkeby

Well this is good... but it will fail...
    because....
        we are still using ganache-cli accounts...

Now we will create the get_account() function...
    all this function has to do.. is check the network
        and decide which account to use....

THEN ADD INFURA PROJECT ID in the .env file..

WELL AFTER ACCOUNT SETTING IS DONE AND .env FILE
IS MODIFIED WITH THE NEW API OF INFURA

#### ITs terminal time

brownie run scripts\deploy.py --network rinkeby

and thats it...
It will be deployed in the network...
    u can also check using the network hash generated
    on the rinkeby etherscan....


GUESS WHAT...
The deployments folder is updated now....
##### DEPLOYMENT FOLDER
This folder separates the deployments based on the chain id

for Rinkeby : 4
for Ganache : 1337 
    as far as i remember.... it could be a mistake too...

best practice is to check the chain ids online...
