Well we did the first part
Deploying on a network was okay...

Now, we will be deploying on our local Ganache 
    but as a network...

basically we will modify our networks list...
    and add the ganache network into that ethereum list...
        then we will deploy our contracts on that...
            so we can see, what is exactly happening...
                and ofc to be fast...

Lets just start by creating a new python file...

We are creating read_value.py
##### read_value.py
