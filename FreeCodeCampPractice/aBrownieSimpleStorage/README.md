BUILD folder
    it tracks all the important low level information

    It keeps all our deployments and interfaces across all the chains
    it stores all the compiled code
    everything will be in build/contracts

    the contracts outside build folder is where all our contracts will be stored

    Scripts are mostly used for automation

    Tests are used for testing stuff in our contracts

    We will also create .env file here
